# Game-of-Thrones---I-ALGO.This implementation checks if the string can be rearranged into a palindrome by verifying that at most one character has an odd frequency count (for odd-length strings) or all characters have even frequencies (for even-length strings), efficiently solving the problem in O(n) time complexity.
